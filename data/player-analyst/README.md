# Player Analyst
Players are the key aspect of the team. Their movement help the teams winning the game. Pundit can analyse the tactics and the roles of each player from the movement. 

## Data
The data contains the player movement coordinate and what the action they do. The actions such as:
- shot: player change to score (on target nor off target)
- shot assist: player shot to the goal but the teammate reflect it to the goal
- dribble: player bring the ball to the certain position
- cross: player remove the ball to the another side (should be flank-to-flank)
- pass: player give the ball to the teammate.

Obtaining the data is simple but need more effort. I use [this app](https://fcpythonvideocoder.netlify.app/) to track the player movement. The tutorial can be watched in [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul3A0VfBIbo&t=487s&ab_channel=McKayJohns). Since you are just allowed to use the Youtube links at that tool, you can use [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJ7dB8U9114&ab_channel=AlarmTimer) to record the timestamps. 


## Notes:
I will add the python code for visualise the movement soon
